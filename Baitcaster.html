<h2 id="-what-is-it-and-why-use-it-"><strong>What is it and why use it?</strong></h2>
<p>A baitcaster is a type of fishing rod that is used for a variety of fishing purposes. It is similar to a traditional spinner rod that many people are familiar with; however, the design of the reel and rod are slightly different. A baitcaster is often used because of its versatility and controllability. A spinner rod is great for fishing open areas with a normal cast but baitcasters are beneficial for situations where an area is not as open and you don’t have a lot of room for a normal cast. Baitcasters allow for more accurate casts and can be used for flipping baits into covered areas.</p>

<h2 id="-assembly-"><strong>Assembly:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="color:gray">Some baitcasters are sold as a rod and reel combination so assembling them together isn’t necessary. However, in the event that you buy them separately, it is simple to attach the reel to the rod.</span>
</p>

</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Start by removing any plastic on the rod or reel.
<br>2. Then, unscrew the threaded keeper at the top of the rod&#39;s grip. 
<br>3. Place the reel seat into the slot on the rod and the other end under the threaded keeper. Make sure the line guide is pointing toward the end of the rod and the release button is on the handle side. 
<br>4. Screw the threaded keeper tightly back.
<br><br><br></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-lining-the-rod-"><strong>Lining the rod:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="color:gray">The next step in preparing your baitcaster is spooling the fishing line on the reel. It is best for most people to start with medium test (6 - 10 lb), monofilament or fluorocarbon line. The instructions are as follows:</span></p>
<p></p>
    <img style="float: right" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/67UTQOKGGTM/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Tying line on baitcaster" width="370" height="230" title="Tying line on baitcaster">
</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Thread the line down the guides of the rod starting at the end opposite the reel and grip.
<br>2. Thread the line through the line guide on the front of the reel.
<br>3. Push the line around the spool and tie a small knot.
<br>4. While applying tension to the line with one hand, crank the reel with the other. Holding the new fishing line spool on a screwdriver or something similar makes it easier and faster to unspool.
<br>5. Continue until the fishing line on the reel reaches just short of the edges of the spool.
<br>6. Clip the line at the end of the rod giving yourself a <br>couple of feet of line to work with.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-br-settings-"><br><strong>Settings:</strong></h2>
<p>After adding your bait to the end of the line, it is important to set your reel to the correct settings before casting. There are a couple of settings that can be tuned to work best with your casting technique, the weight of your bait, and the strength of your line. Before describing the settings, it is important to note that most of the settings are dependent on the user and are set based simply on feel so it may take some trial and error to get them right. Also, reference the picture on the first page if you can’t locate the settings.</p>
<h3 id="-drag-control-"><strong>Drag control:</strong></h3>
<p>Starting with the simplest, the drag control is the spiked wheel that is usually connected to the inner side of the crank and it controls the amount of drag on the line. Increasing the drag makes it more difficult to pull the line out of the reel and decreasing the drag makes it easier. You should rotate the drag control until you can pull the line out of the reel with a good amount of resistance but without struggling. Do this by grabbing the line just in front of the reel and pulling towards the end of the fishing rod. It is also important to note that you may want to decrease the drag when you are using a weaker fishing line or when trying to catch larger fish to lessen the chances of the line snapping.</p>
<h3 id="-spool-tensioner-"><strong>Spool tensioner:</strong></h3>
<p>Another setting on a baitcaster is the spool tensioner which is a small knob that is usually on the same side as the handle of the reel. This changes the tension on the spool and affects how quickly and easily it will unwind. This setting should be changed based on the weight of the bait you have on the rod because it is best practice to increase the spool tension when using heavier bait. Test the tension by pressing the release button just behind the spool. The best setting for the bait you’re using is when the bait slowly falls after you press the button. The setting should be changed if the bait doesn’t fall or if it plummets very quickly. </p>
<h3 id="-brake-setting-"><strong>Brake setting:</strong></h3>
<p>The final setting is the brake setting which is usually on the opposite side of the reel as the handle. It affects how quickly the spool will unwind. Most users who are new to using baitcasters will want to increase this setting since it makes it more resistant to getting a backlash (explained later). It can also depend on the weight of your bait since lighter baits may require a greater braking setting.  This setting requires a few casts to tune it to where it is best for your cast. For those with more experience, decreasing the braking setting can increase the user’s casting distance, especially when using heavier baits.</p>

<h2 id="-casting-"><strong>Casting:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="color:gray">The movement required to cast a baitcaster is the same as casting any other fishing rod. The main differences are the release button and stopping the spool.</span>
</p>

</p>
<br>1. First, release some line until your bait is about a foot from the tip of the rod.
<br>2. Next, press the release button down with your thumb while simultaneously putting pressure on the spooled line with that same thumb.
<br>
<br></p>
<p></p>

</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Raise the rod either behind or beside you and smoothly swing the rod towards the water while releasing your thumb from the spool. The timing may take some practice.</li>
</ol>
<p><br>4. Watch the bait as it flies towards the water and quickly put pressure on the spooled line again right when, or just before, the bait hits the water. Failing to do this will result in a backlash.
<br>

</p>
<span style="color:gray">A backlash is when the reel’s spool spins too quickly and the fishing line can’t make it out of the reel in time. This causes the line to build up in the reel and get tangled. Some backlashes can be small and easily fixed while others get more tangled and result in what many people refer to as a bird&#39;s nest. To avoid this, it is important to cast smoothly and without excessive force. It is also important to stop the spool with your thumb, as previously stated, before the bait hits the water. If you do get a backlash, here&#39;s how to fix it:</span></p>
<p></p>
    <img style="float: right" src="https://www.lafishblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Pull-line-out-to-clear-backlash-from-baitcaster.jpg" alt="Untangling backlash" width="255" height="160" title="Untangling backlash">
</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Start by pressing the release button and gently pulling the line just outside the line guide. It may untangle as you pull but it is rare.
<br>2. If it doesn’t come untangled, try to untangle the line on the spool and then gently pull more out from the line guide.
<br>3. Continue this until the backlash is gone.
<br>4. Then, re-spool the line you pulled out in the same way you spooled it in the beginning (adding pressure to the line with one hand).
<br>5. In the event that the backlash can’t be untangled, you will most likely have to cut the line away and reline the reel.</li>
</ol>
